Main page with a bar with the current date, profile bar on the left which is fixed in the screen (as you scroll up and down, it remains in the same position from the user's perspective), bar with search and sort options and the main tasks area.
In the profile bar, there are the options to visit the user's profile, log out, add a new list and remove a list. There is also a small gif which displays quotes about time and time management:

In order to search for a cateogry, there is a drop down bar with all the category options. If the user selects one, only the tasks in that category are presented:

In order to search for a task, the user must type the task he's looking for. As the user types away, the tasks matching are refined:

Adding a list means creating a new category and adding 1 or more tasks to it:

In order to remove a list/category, the user must type the category's name on the bar. As he types, the matching categories appear and he can select his preferred one or write the full word himself:
